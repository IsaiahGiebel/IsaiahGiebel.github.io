                        I Love Having Fun!!!

                        Where I find the most fun is in rock climbing. I did not begin rock climbing until I was 18, but I had always been a climber of 
                        sorts since I was only 3. At that age I was making ascents
                        of door frames and other structures around the house. In my Elementary and Middle school years my older sister and I would 
                        compete to see who could get the highest up various pine and maple trees in our backyard(a very unsafe game of course). 
                        A couple friends introduced me to rock climbing my last year of highschool and I began going to the bouldering
                        gym near St.Thomas my Freshman year of college everyday during the covid lockdown.
                        Throughout college I have gone on several climbing trips with my friends including trips to Nevada, the Black Hills, and Puerto Rico.

                    <p class="medium-8">
                        There are many other things I enjoy as well. I love my friends and going on walks with them and listening to music
                        with them and playing video games with them. I love food and I love to cook with my friends too. I try to spend 
                        a lot of time outside enjoying nature with my homies and perhaps my favorite place to be outside is the boundary waters
                        because it is so beautiful and peaceful and everyone is living in that moment with no other worries.

                    <p class="medium-8">
                        When I am not climbing or with my friends I have fun by listening to many varieties of happy music and chill music and by watching new movies. 
                        I try to study Spanish on duolingo when I get the chance which is sometimes fun. I have been trying to watch
                        more Spanish movies too, but it is a little difficult to find good ones on Amazon Prime. When I am alone I also eat
                        a lot of snacks. When I am back home during the summer I spend a lot of time with my siblings. I have a couple of older
                        siblings and many younger siblings and so it is always busy in my house. My family also has a few cats and a few kittens.
